# TTK4255: Robotic Vision

Sprint 2021 - With Simon Lexau

**The Midterm Project** was about estimating yaw, pitch and roll angles of a Quanser 3-DOF Helicopter by using a pre-recorded image sequence of the helicopter in motion. The helicopter was augmented witg fiducial markers. To estimate the angles, we used the versatile approach of minimizing the reprojection error between the markers' predicted and detected image locations. We used the Levenberg-Marquardt method to minimize the reprojection error. In the last part, we no longer took the length measurements of the joints of the helicopter for granted, and estimated those as well, leading to even better results. 

In the **Final Project** we took pictures of a spesific entry to the Electical Building at Gl√∏shaugen, Trondheim. We used structure-based localization to determine the 3D position and orientation from which any of the pictures were taken. We also made a 3D model of the architectural structure and its environment.
